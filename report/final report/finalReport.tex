\section{Introduction}
In this final report we will present our non-trivial demonstrator, \textit{PUTTHENAME}, a web application that allows to navigate through running/biking tracks and exercise spots, that a user might use to record his workouts and look for a place where to do sport.
Our server provides a \textit{SPARQL} endpoint that can be used to query the data in our database and retrieve information according to four different ontologies, carefully linked between each other to provide a complete open information system.

We will begin describing the different ontologies we used and how we mapped to them, followed by the tools we used to develop and run our non-trivial demonstrator to finish with a description on what we achieved with our application.
